## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a web application framework
-Node.js is as open source framework, free, runs on various operating systems, and uses javascript. It takes a request from a client to get data from a computer file system and can ready another request thereafter. Once a server has opened and read data that is requested it returns the content to the client. There is no waiting on this process as there is for PHP and ASP. Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously, and is memory efficient.

## What is Express?
Express is a tool used to develop server code
- If I had to work on web and mobile apps, a web development framework like Express would provide robust features to get things done! Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web app framework.

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
I understand that express uses middleware and sets up routing.
-

## What is Middleware?
Middleware are libraries that allow different functions in between express functions.
-To build a massive, complex, and powerful application to get something done we use middleware within our web app frameworks to facilitate a standard communication between complex systems. Middleware can parse, authenticate, or standardize how data is communicated between systems.

## What is a Resource?
A resource can be any data on a server.
-

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
An HTTP response status in the 200-299 range can help a client know that a request was successful.
-

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
Sub-applications can be created through the use of express' routing feature.
-

## What is CORS and why do we need it?
-Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain other than from the origin of that resource. Things that a web page can freely embed:

cross-origin images
stylesheets
scripts
iframes
videos
